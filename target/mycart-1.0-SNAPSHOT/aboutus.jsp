        <h4>An e-commerce website, also known as a cybermall or online marketplace, is a website where businesses can sell their products or services to consumers over the internet. E-commerce websites typically provide a platform for businesses to showcase their products and enable customers to browse, compare and purchase products online.

E-commerce websites typically include features such as product catalogues, shopping carts, payment gateways, and order management systems. These features allow businesses to manage their online sales, process orders, and receive payments securely.

One of the advantages of e-commerce websites is that they enable businesses to reach a wider audience and increase sales by allowing customers to shop from anywhere in the world, at any time of the day. E-commerce websites also allow businesses to reduce their overhead costs by eliminating the need for a physical storefront and associated expenses such as rent, utilities, and staffing.

However, e-commerce websites also face challenges such as competition from other online retailers, cybersecurity risks, and the need to continually update and optimize their website to stay relevant and attract customers.
